TextAtAnyCost
=============

Old PHP scripts to read text content from different binary formats:
* DOC/PPT (using self-written CFB basic module)
* PDF
* RTF

As a bonus I included two modules to work with RAR archives without any additional extensions or programs:
* read file list
* create RAR archive without any compression or encryption
